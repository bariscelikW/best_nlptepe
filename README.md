You can easily test it google colab,

This repository was generated from the Jupyter notebook `best_nlptepe.ipynb`. 
It includes:
- The original notebook (in `notebooks/`)
- A Python script export of the notebook's code cells (in `scripts/`)
- An auto-generated `requirements.txt`
- A `.gitignore` suitable for Python/Jupyter projects

> Tip: GitHub renders `.ipynb` files directly, so you can view the notebook in the browser.

## Quick Start

### 1) Clone & set up a virtual environment
```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub (empty), then clone it locally
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL> best-nlptepe
cd best-nlptepe

# Copy the contents of this zip into the repo folder if needed
# (If you downloaded this as a zip, unzip and move files here.)

# Create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.10+ recommended)
python -m venv .venv
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2) Use the notebook
```bash
pip install jupyter
jupyter lab  # or: jupyter notebook
```
Open `notebooks/best_nlptepe.ipynb` and run the cells.

### 3) Or run the script version
The `scripts/best_nlptepe.py` file contains all code cells concatenated, with IPython magics commented out.
```bash
python scripts/best_nlptepe.py
```

> If your notebook relies on specific data files or environment variables, place them under a `data/` directory or configure them via a `.env` file and update the code accordingly.

## Recommended Project Structure

```
best-nlptepe/
├─ notebooks/
│  └─ best_nlptepe.ipynb
├─ scripts/
│  └─ best_nlptepe.py
├─ data/                 # (optional) datasets, ignored by git if you add to .gitignore
├─ requirements.txt
├─ .gitignore
└─ README.md
```

## How to Publish to GitHub (Step-by-Step)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (no README, no .gitignore, empty).
2. On your machine:
   ```bash
   git init
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: add notebook, script, and setup files"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Dependencies

The `requirements.txt` was auto-generated by scanning the notebook's imports.

Detected top-level packages: **dots_ocr, qwen_vl_utils, sentence-transformers, torch, transformers**

> Review and pin versions if needed (e.g., `pandas==2.2.2`).

## Notes

- If the notebook includes long-running cells or environment-specific paths, consider modularizing the code into functions and a `main()` entry point inside the script file.
- To keep your repository lightweight, avoid committing large datasets or model artifacts; host them elsewhere and download at runtime.
- Add a LICENSE (e.g., MIT) if you plan to share publicly.
